    - [Quote API](https://quotable.io/) - Get Quotes Data and it is main api.
    - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/) - This api give us detail of author.
    - [Picsum](https://picsum.photos/)- To get Random Image for every time.
- [MVVM Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) - A software architecture that removes the tight coupling between components. Most importantly, in this architecture, the children don't have the direct reference to the parent, they only have the reference by observables.
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
- [Jetpack Components](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
    - [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)- Modern toolkit for building native UI.
    - [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html) - Provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack and Android platform APIs.
    - [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - Major improvement to the original Android [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.
    -   [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
    - [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite used for offline data caching.
    - [Preferences Datastore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) - Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.
    - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
- [Compose Destinations](https://composedestinations.rafaelcosta.xyz/) - A KSP library that processes annotations and generates code that uses Official Jetpack Compose Navigation under the hood.

requests on the data layer for Entities and understands Kotlin non-nullable 
and default parameters.
